# NITPICK (WIP)

Nitpick is a lightweight and customizable linting plugin for Neovim. It allows you to easily integrate and configure linters for various programming languages. Nitpick searches both local project-based linters and global system-wide linters, ensuring that your linting tools are always available and consistent across all your projects.


## TODO
- [ ] ability for use to list their filetype and linter of choice
- [ ] append the linter diagnostic to vim diagnostic
